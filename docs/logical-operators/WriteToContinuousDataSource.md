# WriteToContinuousDataSource Unary Logical Operator

`WriteToContinuousDataSource` is a unary logical operator (`LogicalPlan`) that is created when `ContinuousExecution` is requested to [run a streaming query in continuous mode](../continuous-execution/ContinuousExecution.md#runContinuous) (to create an [IncrementalExecution](../IncrementalExecution.md)).

`WriteToContinuousDataSource` is planned (_translated_) to a [WriteToContinuousDataSourceExec](../physical-operators/WriteToContinuousDataSourceExec.md) unary physical operator (when `DataSourceV2Strategy` execution planning strategy is requested to plan a logical query).
